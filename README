This is software developed by TTC Technology Company using opensource computer vision library,
for detecting faces and searching images using image descriptor.
Detect a real time fraud and alerting on a real time using frames per second to analyse for fraud
activity using neural network.

Internal Implementation it uses one server:
    1.Running torch or cv2.dnn model for detecting fraud in frames per second, then reporting back to
     the connected clients for any accident using special response.
    

Note clients on first connection are required to log in using credentials which is stored in a sqlite3 database file.

Several other technology are used such as pygame to use Computer Speaker for alerting in case of fraud.
WxPython3 which is used to construct the Graphical user interface.
We use UDP for transferring frame so that it become more efficient than TCP  even if some frame are missing.
