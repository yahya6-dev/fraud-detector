This is software developed by TTC Technology Company using opensource computer vision library,
for detecting faces and searching images using image descriptor.
Detect a real time fraud and alerting on a real time using frames per second to analyse for fraud
acivity using neural network.

Internal Implementation it uses two servers:
    1.Running torch or cv2.dnn model for detecting fraud in frames per second, then reporting back to
    the second server, that imform the connected clients for any incident.
    2.Second server bridge the connection between the first server and clients, but its uses is to record a camera frames back to the connected clients such desktop or mobile phones, while running several computation such as detecting faces, detecting motion ie.

Note clients on first connection are required to log in using credentials which is stored in a sqlite3 database file.

Several other technology are used such as pygame to use Computer Speaker for alerting in case of fraud.
WxPython3 which is use to construct the Graphical user interface.
We use UDP for transferring frame so that it become more efficient than TCP  even if some frame are missing.
